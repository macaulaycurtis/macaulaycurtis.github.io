## Fiscal years in Japanese accounting

I've decided to inaugurate this legal translation blog by talking about a topic that's not actually law, but accounting. As corporate law is ultimately all about money, a lot of the documents that I end up working on fall at least partially into the field properly called "financial translation," of which I am by no means an expert. As good translators, we are supposed to spend time familiarizing ourselves with any terminology and concepts that we don't understand, but in practice it's hard to justify doing that for every document -- I've got work to do! So this post, and this blog, will be a place for me to record the fruits of my occasional research in a way that will hopefully save someone else a bit of trouble.

This post will cover terms like 年度, 会計期間, 事業年度, and 連結会計年度, which all basically refer to a fiscal year. These terms appear all over convocation notices, annual reports, and even in the occasional contract, and they all look pretty similar, but there are some surprising differences. Let's get into it.

### 年度 in English
When we refer to a year, such as 2022, what we are usually talking about is the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, also known as a calendar year (暦年). In Japan, the personal income tax operates on a calendar year basis, which is why income tax adjustments for company employees happen in December. The calendar year is also used by sole traders (個人事業主) for accounting, because their business profit is considered a part of their personal income. In other words, the tax year (課税年度) for individuals is the same as the calendar year.

However, like much of Japanese life, the corporate fiscal year traditionally operates on an April-March calendar. The year 2022 is from January 1 to December 31 but the fiscal year 2022 is from April 1 to March 31. But... which April to which March?

| Fiscal year | End date |
|---|---|
| 2022年度 (Japanese Government) | (April) 2023 |
| FY2022 (US Government) | (September) 2022 |
| 2022年3月期 | March 2022 |
| YE March 2022 | March 2022 |
| 22/3期 | March 2022 |
| FY3/22 | March 2022 |

As you can see, the convention in Japan is for YY年度 to be the year that starts in YY and ends in the following year, but the convention in English is for "fiscal year Y" to be the year that *ends* in YY. Some clever translators have noticed this, and make sure to add one when translating financial documents into English, but I think the majority of Japanese companies' financial disclosures in English technically get this wrong[^1].

On the other hand, corporate disclosures have to be kept consistent every year, and translating 2022年度 as FY2023 is asking for trouble down the line. Every time that text is translated for the rest of eternity, you have to remember to add one to all the 年度s, but not the other numbers. It might be more prudent to let the reader figure out that the Japanese convention is different, rather than making a rod for your editor's back every single year.

### 会計期間 in English
Another reason why 年度 is something of a pain, and a fantastic argument for sticking to YY年MM月期 in Japanese, is that a company can decide its own accounting period (会計期間). To quote  Article 13(1) of the Corporation Tax Act (法人税法):

| この法律において「事業年度」とは、法人の財産及び損益の計算の単位となる期間（以下この章において「会計期間」という。）で、法令で定めるもの又は法人の定款(中略)に定めるものを(中略)いう。ただし、これらの期間が一年を超える場合は、当該期間をその開始の日以後一年ごとに区分した各期間（最後に一年未満の期間を生じたときは、その一年未満の期間）をいう。 | In this Act, "Business Year" means the period that serves as the unit for the calculation of a corporation's assets, income, and expenditure ("Accounting Period"), and which is defined by law or in the articles of incorporation [...] of that corporation. However, if those periods exceed one year, that period refers to each one-year period after the start of that period (and any period less than one year that arises at the end). |

The proviso is tortured in Japanese and I have rendered it in tortured English, but I am assured that the interpretation is that a company can choose any period not longer than a year as its accounting period. It seems that in other countries it isn't unusual for a company to use a 52-week year, with a 53-week leap year every so often. This is kosher under IFRS, but since 53 weeks is longer than a year, I suppose it would not be allowed in Japan (check with your qualified tax accountant). At the same time, despite having the option, there is not much reason for a Japanese company to go through the arduous and expensive process of finalizing its accounts (決算) more than once a year - the National Tax Agency's [statistics](https://www.nta.go.jp/publication/statistics/kokuzeicho/hojin2020/hojin.htm) for 2020/2021 show about 1% of companies chose to make biannual filings in that fiscal year. In other words, 99% of accounting periods in Japan are exactly one year, so it is very reasonable to translate 会計期間 as "fiscal year" when the context doesn't require more precision than that.

Those statistics also show that the most common fiscal year-end (年度末／決算期) is of course March (about 17% of the total, and about 50% of large-cap companies), followed by September (overall) or December (for large-cap companies). The more you know.

### 事業年度 in English
You may have noticed that the definition of 会計期間 above is actually a part of the definition for 事業年度. Read it again and you will see that the two are actually identical, one and the same thing. The "business year" is the "accounting period" that the Company chooses to adopt, presumably even in the 1% of cases where that period is not actually 12 months.

The official-unofficial [Standard Legal Terms Dictionary](https://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/en/dicts/download) insists that 事業年度 is a "business year," so if you're translating legislation or something very close to it (like articles of incorporation), that is certainly your best bet. But for your own understanding, please remember that 事業年度＝会計期間, and therefore "fiscal year" is definitely on the table as an easily comprehensible translation.

### 連結会計年度 in English
When a company has subsidiaries, it needs to report accounts not only for itself but also for its entire corporate group. Accounting for a parent and its subsidiaries and affiliates is called "consolidated accounting" (連結会計), so the year for which consolidated accounts are reported is the "consolidated fiscal year" (連結会計年度).

Note that 連結 modifies 会計 and not 年度, so this is not a "consolidated year," it is "one year in the context of consolidated accounting." Picky clients might prefer that this be rendered "fiscal year on a consolidated basis," but frankly I think that's a bit of a mouthful.

A question remains in my mind as to whether it is possible for a group's consolidated fiscal year to have a different year-end to its parent company's business year. My guess is that it might be possible but it's just never done.

By the way, 会計年度 is only used to refer to the government's fiscal year - for companies it's 事業年度 for one company and 連結会計年度 for a group. The term "accounting year" has some currency in English, but not a lot, so I can't really recommend it.

### Year ending? Year ended?
In the table up there in the 年度 section I have included the abbreviation "YE March 2022," which is the standard in New Zealand and Australia, but apparently not as common in other parts of our variegated English-speaking world. Nevertheless, I use it at every opportunity, and not just out of national pride. It's concise, it's hard to misinterpret, and best of all, it avoids the "ending"/"ended" distinction.

The what? Well, some clients (and translators) insist that the current fiscal year is the "year ending March 2023," and all past years are the "year ended March 2022/21/20/etc." On the face of it, this isn't totally unreasonable, and if someone asks for it I am happy enough to give it to them. But as a linguist, it rubs me the wrong way. No matter how hard I look, I can't find any indication that native speakers make this distinction in practice:
- [Here](https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/papers-presented/current-papers/document/PAP_121064/otago-fish-and-game-council-report-for-the-year-ending) is an NZ government report for the "year ending 31 August 2021," published in March 2022
- [Here](https://sites.ontariotechu.ca/finance/planning-reporting/financial-statements/index.php) is a Canadian university, with all its past accounts titled "for the year ending."
- [Here](https://www.investegate.co.uk/appreciate-group-plc/rns/full-year-results/202008120700048918V/) is a UK company's annual report from 2020, which mentions "the forecast for the year ended 31 March 2021."
The list of counterexamples goes on and on.

I suspect that this fictitious distinction actually comes from Japanese. In English, "ing"/"ed" distinction indicates whether the noun is the agent or the patient, that is, whether the verb is active or passive. The difference between "The man naming Henry" and "the man named Henry" is not one of time, but of agency - did the man give the name, or receive it? In Japanese, however, 太郎を名づける男 is always "the man who will name Henry," and "太郎を名づけた男" is "the man who named Henry." This isn't normally a source of confusion, so I imagine it's not part of the EFL curriculum, but it just so happens that we can talk about a period of time "ending" or "being ended," both in active and passive voice. This suggests a distinction between the two that doesn't really exist. They're the same.

In any case, I would like to advocate for the world at large to start using the abbreviation "YE" so that we can forget about the whole thing. The "FY3/22" convention, which is only used in analyst reports as far as I can tell, is also a delightful alternative.

### What's a financial year?
I have used "fiscal year" throughout this post because it is considered the standard in American English. "Financial year" refers to the same thing and is perfectly cromulent English, but if your style guide is strict about using American English, I suggest you go with "fiscal."

### Wrap-up
That about covers it for fiscal years in Japanese accounting. I hope that having this information available in English will save some other translator the trouble of looking it up. If I got anything extraordinarily wrong, please send me an email and I will correct it.

Fins a la pròxima!
